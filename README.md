Instead of randomly appearing, creatures mate to reproduce.

Initially you will have very basic creature that you can cross to unlock more powerfull creature.

Main rules are:
 - Female can copulate with Male to be pregnant
 - Once pregnancy end, the new creature will be available. Player can chose to adopt it or not. 
 - Creature of same species produce new born of the same species. A Gnome mating with a Gnome will produce a Gnome.
 - New born will inherits special traits from their parent. A parent Orc with "Magic Resistance" have a 50% chance to give this trait to its children.
 - Some mutation may happen on new born. The new special trait may be a good one or a bad one.
 - New species appears by crossing two differents species. When this occurs, the resulting new born is "First generation". For example, crossing a Gnome with a Bandit may result as an Orc.
 - The crossing matrix is randomly generated at the begining of the game. Thus if Gnome and Bandit cross to an Orc once, this crossing will always produce Orc.
 - New born by crossing two differents species are ""First generation" and do not inherits special traits from their parent.
 - Creature of the "First generation" can only reproduce with creature of same species.
